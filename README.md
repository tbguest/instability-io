Fun with nonlinear systems. All animations are drawn on-the-fly with client-side JavaScript.

Next.js, TypeScript, HTML canvas

Why I'm using a bundler:

- I wanted a smooth and enjoyable dev (server) experience
- imports/exports without declaring modules
- I don't plan to lean on npm imports very heavily for this project (or perhaps even at all), but you never know...
- Support for CSS modules, or some form of scoped CSS
- I wanted a testing framework
